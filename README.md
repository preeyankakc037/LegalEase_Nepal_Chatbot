LegalBot123
LegalBot123 is a Python-based legal chatbot application designed to provide automated responses to legal queries by leveraging a database of legal documents and a vectorized search index. The application uses a web interface to interact with users and manages user data in a secure database.
Project Structure

ingest.py: Script to process and ingest legal documents into the system.
main.py: Core application script, likely handling the chatbot logic and web server.
legal_docs/: Directory containing legal documents used by the chatbot.
static/: Directory for static assets (e.g., CSS, JavaScript, images) for the web interface.
templates/: Directory for HTML templates used in the web interface.
view_users.py: Script to manage or display user data from the users.db database.
requirements.txt / requirement.txt: Lists project dependencies.
users.db: SQLite database for storing user information.
legal_chatbot.db: SQLite database for chatbot-related data.
embeddings.pkl: Pickle file storing precomputed document embeddings for search.
faiss_index/: Directory containing FAISS index for efficient similarity search.

Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher
Virtual environment (recommended)
Dependencies listed in requirements.txt

Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository:
git clone <repository-url>
cd LEGAL_BOT123


Set Up a Virtual Environment:
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Ingest Legal Documents:Run the ingestion script to process legal documents and create embeddings:
python ingest.py


Run the Application:Start the web server to launch the chatbot:
python main.py


Access the Chatbot:Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000 (or the port specified in main.py).


Usage

Interact with the Chatbot: Use the web interface to input legal queries, and the chatbot will respond based on the indexed legal documents.
Manage Users: Use view_users.py to view or manage user data stored in users.db:python view_users.py



Development Notes

Ensure legal_docs/ contains relevant legal documents before running ingest.py.
The faiss_index/ and embeddings.pkl are generated by ingest.py and used for efficient document retrieval.
Update requirements.txt if additional dependencies are added.
